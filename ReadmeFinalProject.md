### Conductivity, Denisty, and Temerpature Profiles from the Salish Sea
###### By: Annabelle Quinlisk

Goal: Visulaize different oceanographic properites of the Salish Sea.

Motivation: In October 2022, my peers and I went on research cruises in Bellingham Bay and Rosairo Strait to collect water samples and data. To do so, a CDT device was used at six different locations. However, that data has yet to be visulaized so I intend to create conductivity, desity, and temperature profiles of the locations we obtained data from.

Data: Data from each site is in a csv file that contains measurments of different oceanographic properties such as temperature and salinity taken in 0.25 second intervals down then up the water column. The data will be included in the GitHub Repository.

Analysis Method: Each property will be analyzed in graphical from. A seperate line graph will be used for each site to visulaize how each property changes with respect to depth. Also, the coordinates from each site will be mapped as a reference for each location.
